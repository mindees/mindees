Post-review hardening pass over the audit fixes (follow-ups confirmed with regression tests), plus a cross-package typecheck repair:

- **`@mindees/renderer` — SSR element-tag injection (security)** — `serializeHeadless` interpolated the (possibly `mapTag`-mapped) tag into `<tag>`/`</tag>` unescaped, so a tag containing `>`/whitespace could break out and inject markup. The tag is now validated against the attribute-name grammar and rejected (fail closed) if unsafe.
- **`@mindees/atlas` — `Pressable` style typecheck regression** — tightening `Accessor<T>` to a strict `() => T` left the 1-arg interaction-state style fn leaking into the `resolveStyle` branch. The arity-narrowed branch now asserts `Reactive<StyleInput>`, mirroring the state-fn cast, so the package typechecks again.
- **`@mindees/atlas` — horizontal `ScrollView` layout was inert** — the row layout set `flexDirection`/`flexWrap` without `display: 'flex'`, so the element stayed in default block flow. `display: 'flex'` is now included.
- **`@mindees/ai` — Anthropic streaming dropped `input_tokens`** — prompt tokens arrive on `message_start` while output tokens arrive on `message_delta`; the parser now carries `input_tokens` through to the finish chunk instead of reporting only output tokens.
- **`@mindees/data` — HLC drift ceiling could ratchet** — the clamp ceiling is anchored to `physical + maxDriftMs` (not `max(localWall, physical) + maxDriftMs` re-added per merge), so repeated far-future merges can't walk the clock forward. The LWW same-stamp tie-break also tags `-0` distinctly from `+0` so a `-0`-vs-`+0` tie still converges.
- **`@mindees/updates` — non-idempotent re-apply** — re-applying the already-current generation fell through and rewrote state, resetting `pendingVerification`/`bootAttempts` and un-confirming a generation that had already passed its readiness handshake. It now short-circuits to a true no-op.
- **`@mindees/compiler` — marker collision missed destructuring** — the `_static` top-level collision check ignored destructuring bindings (`const { _static } = x`); it now recurses object/array binding patterns so flattening still bails on a real collision.
- **`@mindees/cli` — overly specific scaffold error** — the unreadable-target message asserted "not a directory" for every `readDir` failure even though it could be a permission/I/O error; the message no longer claims a cause it didn't verify.
