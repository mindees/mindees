Audit hardening for `@mindees/compiler` (MDC), `@mindees/cli` (Forge), and `create-mindees`. An adversarial review confirmed nine defects (one refuted); each is fixed with a regression test.

**@mindees/compiler**
- **Flatten demoted a leading directive prologue (high)** — injecting `const _static` after only the leading *imports* placed it before a `"use client"`/`"use server"`/`"use strict"` directive, demoting it to a no-op string expression (the transform claims to be "purely additive"). The marker is now inserted after the leading directive prologue *and* imports.
- **Unhygienic `_static` marker (medium)** — if user code already bound `_static`, a second `const _static` was injected (a `SyntaxError`). The pass now bails out of flattening a module that already binds `_static` rather than emitting broken code.
- **Non-injective chunk names (medium)** — `blog/[slug]` and `blog/slug` are distinct routes but both stripped to `route_blog_slug`; `buildRouteManifest` only deduped by route path. It now also rejects chunk-name collisions.
- **Build doc/dead-code mismatch (low)** — the single-module gate drops unresolved-import (`TS2307`) diagnostics, so `build.ts`'s "reports these as warnings" claim was false; the docs now state the gate filters them upstream (the downgrade is a defensive backstop).

**@mindees/cli**
- **`dev` rebuild could kill the session (low)** — a throwing rebuild (e.g. a file removed mid-watch) escaped the orchestrator. It is now caught into a failed `BuildResult`, so the session keeps watching.
- **`create` onto an existing FILE crashed (medium)** — the real `readDir` throws `ENOTDIR` on a file target, which escaped uncaught. `scaffold` now catches it and returns a clean error.
- **Unsafe `cd` hint quoting (medium)** — `quoteShellPath` used double quotes, so a directory name containing `$(...)`/backticks/`$VAR` could execute when the printed `cd` hint was pasted. It now uses POSIX single-quote (literal) quoting.
- **UNC path corruption (low)** — `resolveCreateTarget` silently collapsed `\\server\share` to a single-slash path; UNC inputs are now rejected with a clear error.
- **Empty `--template` precedence divergence (low)** — `mindees create --template ""` failed with "Unknown template" while `create-mindees` deferred to the prompt/default. Both now treat an empty `--template` as "not chosen".

All three packages' exported `info` objects are now frozen (consistency).
