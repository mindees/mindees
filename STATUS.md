# STATUS — what actually works today

This file is the **single source of truth** for MindeesNative's maturity. It is
deliberately conservative. If something is not listed as working here, assume it
does not work.

**Last updated:** Phase 9D (Pulse — server-driven UI). **Phase 9 (Pulse) is now
complete**: `@mindees/updates` ships the signed-OTA core (9A), differential downloads
(9B), the reference update server (9C), and now **SDUI** (9D) at the
`@mindees/updates/sdui` subpath — `compileSdui` turns an allowlisted, schema-versioned
JSON tree into a `@mindees/core` `MindeesNode` (named actions + reactive bindings, no
`eval`, prototype-pollution-safe, hard limits), plus pure-TS RFC 7396 merge-patch and a
safe RFC 6902 subset for incremental updates (re-validated before render). The WASM
module runtime stays a 🔬 research track.

Phase 9C (Pulse — reference update server): `@mindees/updates` exposes a
**pure, capability-injected update server core** at the `@mindees/updates/server`
subpath (`createUpdateServer`): `resolveUpdate` does channel selection, deterministic
staged rollout, an anti-downgrade mirror, freeze (expiry), and rollback directives;
`getAsset` serves content-addressed blobs (incl. deltas). It **never signs** (serves
pre-signed manifests only). A runnable `node:http` adapter lives in
`examples/pulse-server/`.

Phase 9B (Pulse — differential bundle diffing): `@mindees/updates` ships a
**zero-dependency, pure-TS byte-level delta codec** (`diff` build-side, `applyDelta`
on-device): a changed asset can be shipped as just its delta against a base blob the
client already holds, reconstructed on-device and verified against the manifest's
SHA-256 (a bad/forged delta can never install — it falls back to a full download).

Phase 9A (Pulse — signed OTA core): `@mindees/updates` ships the
working core an app embeds for over-the-air updates: a versioned, hash-addressed
manifest; Ed25519 signing/verification (threshold + key rotation, pure-JS `@noble`,
runs on Hermes/RN); a content-addressed store; and an update client with atomic
generations + crash-loop rollback (verify → download → atomic apply → boot-recovery).

Phase 8E (Helix native strand — on-device render verification): the
JS side has both halves of the native path: the **native command backend**
(`createNativeCommandBackend()`, Phase 8A) and a strict **reference host**
(`createReferenceHost()`, Phase 8B). The real host projects in `examples/native-hosts/`
are **CI-verified** to compile + pass their conformance cores (iOS `swift test` + iOS-SDK
compile, Phase 8C; Android `gradle test` + `assembleDebug`, Phase 8D) **and to render
the command stream into correct native view trees on the platform runtime** (Phase 8E):
an iOS Simulator XCTest asserts the real `UIView` hierarchy, and an Android Robolectric
test asserts the real `android.view` hierarchy (incl. click dispatch via `performClick()`).
**What is NOT yet done: a full app on a physical device** — there is no embedded JS
engine / JS↔native bridge running the reactive app on-device, so **you cannot build a
native mobile app end-to-end with MindeesNative today** — that is Phase 8F.

Phase 7 (Quantum Router II) — complete (render integration +
data/guards/transitions). `@mindees/router` renders (`createRouterView` —
fine-grained, layout-preserving nested rendering; `createLink` — typed links) and
now also does **data loaders** with stale-while-revalidate caching, `AbortSignal`
cancellation, `invalidate()` and `preload()` (intent prefetch); **navigation
guards** (`beforeNavigate` cancel/redirect + idempotent navigation); and **web
view transitions** (`document.startViewTransition`, feature-detected, SSR/native-
safe). Built on `@mindees/core` (the renderer is a test-only devDependency).
Still deferred (not exported): the global typed route registry, file-based route
scanning + bundler plugin, per-key fine-grained loader signals, and native
shared-element transitions.

Phase 6 (Router I) shipped the typed routing core: codegen-free typed path params
(template-literal types), Standard-Schema-validated typed search params (any
Zod/Valibot/ArkType schema, zero runtime dep), a signals-native router with typed
+ relative navigation and selector-isolated route state, dynamic reconfiguration
without state reset, and injectable history (memory + browser).

| ✅ **Stable** | Implemented, tested, documented; safe to rely on (within `0.x`). |
| 🧪 **Experimental** | Implemented but API may change; use with care. |
| 🔬 **Research track** | Not implemented. Public symbols (if any) throw `NotImplementedError` and are marked `@experimental`. |
| 📋 **Planned** | Not started; design pending. |
| 🚧 **Scaffold** | Package exists and builds, but exports only metadata (`name`, `VERSION`, `maturity`, `info`), the `Maturity`/`PackageInfo` status types, and `NotImplementedError` / `notImplemented` utilities. |

## Per-package

| Package | Maturity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@mindees/core` | 🧪 Experimental | Phase 1 reactivity + Phase 2 component model, selector-isolated context, priority scheduler & thread-pool (Web Worker + inline). Native multi-threading is 🔬. |
| `@mindees/compiler` | 🧪 Experimental | MDC build-time optimizer (type-check gate, TSX→createElement, tree-flattening, per-route manifest, plugin API) on the TS Compiler API shipped in Phase 4. TS→native AOT is 🔬. |
| `@mindees/cli` | 🧪 Experimental | Forge CLI shipped in Phase 5: create (+ templates), build (via the compiler), doctor, info, dev rebuild-orchestrator. Live dev-server HTTP/HMR transport is a preview. |
| `@mindees/router` | 🧪 Experimental | Quantum Router I (Phase 6) + II (Phase 7). I: codegen-free typed path params, Standard-Schema validated typed search params, signals-native router state with selector isolation, typed + relative navigation, dynamic reconfiguration, memory + browser history.

| `@mindees/renderer` | 🧪 Experimental | Helix reconciler + web/DOM backend + SSR/hydration + headless backend shipped in Phase 3. **Phase 8A** added the native command backend (`createNativeCommandBackend()`): a serializable `NativeCommand` protocol + a `HostBackend` that emits it (events as stable handler ids; subtree-safe disposal). **Phase 8B** added `createReferenceHost()`: a strict reference host that replays + validates the stream — the conformance contract real native hosts implement. The `examples/native-hosts/` iOS + Android host projects compile + pass their conformance cores in CI (Phase 8C/8D) and render the command stream into correct native view trees on the platform runtime (iOS Simulator XCTest; Android Robolectric — Phase 8E).

| `create-mindees` | 🧪 Experimental | `npm create mindees` scaffolder shipped in Phase 5; delegates to `@mindees/cli`'s tested core. |

## Standing research tracks (the honest frontier)

These are real seams in the architecture, deliberately **not** faked. Each has
(or will have) a documented working fallback:

- **TypeScript → native machine code (AOT).** Fallback: typed paths optimized,
  dynamic paths run on an embedded engine / the web target. _(Phase 4)_
- **Native iOS/Android renderer backends.** The platform-neutral **native command
  backend** (Phase 8A) plus a strict **reference host** that replays + validates the
  command stream (Phase 8B) are implemented and tested. The real **iOS (SwiftPM) and
  Android (Gradle) host projects** in `examples/native-hosts/` now **compile + pass
  their conformance cores in CI** (macOS runner: iOS `swift test` + iOS-SDK compile,
  Phase 8C; Linux runner: Android `gradle test` + `assemble`, Phase 8D), **and render
  the command stream into correct native view trees on the platform runtime** (iOS
  Simulator XCTest; Android Robolectric incl. click dispatch — Phase 8E). What remains
  🔬 is a **full app on a physical device** (embedded JS engine + JS↔native bridge
  running the reactive app on-device) — Phase 8F. Fallback today: web/DOM.
  _(Phase 3, 8A, 8B, 8C, 8D, 8E)_
- **GPU canvas strand (wgpu/WebGPU).** _(Phase 3+)_
- **On-device LLM runtime (ExecuTorch / Apple Foundation Models / Gemini Nano).**
  Fallback: deterministic mock + server backend. _(Phase 10)_
- **Sandboxed WASM Component-Model module runtime.** Fallback: first-party
  modules + a validated declarative subset. _(Phases 8/11)_
