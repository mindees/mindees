# STATUS — what actually works today

This file is the **single source of truth** for MindeesNative's maturity. It is
deliberately conservative. If something is not listed as working here, assume it
does not work.

**Last updated:** Phase 10E/10F (Continuum — reference server + persistence).
**Phase 10 (Continuum) is complete**: on top of the core (10A–10D), `@mindees/data` now
also has a capability-injected reference sync server (`@mindees/data/server` +
`createSyncServer` over an injected op log, with a runnable `node:http` example) and a
`Persistence` contract + engine `export()`/restore so a replica resumes after restart
with stable identity. Native SQLite persistence + Yjs/Automerge/Loro interop are 🔬
research tracks.

The Continuum core (10A–10D): `@mindees/data` does the reactive offline store + delta
sync + conflict resolution that defines it. 10D adds idempotent HLC-stamped `Op`s, a
convergent `MutationLog` (record-level LWW via 10C `mergeRegister`), a `SyncTransport`
contract + an in-memory `createMemoryHub`, and `createSyncEngine` (optimistic local
`set`/`delete`; `sync()` = push + pull + merge). Two peers converge after concurrent
offline edits, duplicate delivery, and out-of-order pulls — proven in a pure unit test.
A reference sync server (10E) and native persistence (10F) are research-track follow-ups.

Phase 10C (Continuum — CRDT conflict resolution): `@mindees/data` has
state-based CRDTs — a per-field HLC-stamped LWW-Register/Map (same-stamp ties broken by
content) and an add-wins OR-Set — all `fast-check`-proven convergent + pollution-safe.

Phase 10B (Continuum — causality primitives): `@mindees/data` has a
Hybrid Logical Clock (`createClock` — monotonic total causal order, injected physical
clock, counter-overflow + untrusted-remote drift guards, lexicographically-sortable
encoding) and version vectors, exhaustively property-tested (fast-check).

Phase 10A (Continuum — reactive local-first store): `@mindees/data`
ships `createCollection`: a signals-native, in-memory document store with
fine-grained reactive reads (`get`/`has`/`all`/`where`/`size`), atomic mutations
(`insert`/`upsert`/`update`/`delete`/`clear`/`tx`), and optimistic changes with
`rollback()`. Built on `@mindees/core` signals only (zero new deps). HLC causality
(10B), CRDT conflict resolution (10C), and the delta-sync engine (10D) build on it;
on-device native persistence + a production sync server are research tracks.

Phase 9 (Pulse) complete: `@mindees/updates` ships the signed-OTA core (9A),
differential downloads (9B), the reference update server (9C), and **SDUI** (9D) at the
`@mindees/updates/sdui` subpath — `compileSdui` turns an allowlisted, schema-versioned
JSON tree into a `@mindees/core` `MindeesNode` (named actions + reactive bindings, no
`eval`, prototype-pollution-safe, hard limits), plus pure-TS RFC 7396 merge-patch and a
safe RFC 6902 subset for incremental updates (re-validated before render). The WASM
module runtime stays a 🔬 research track.

Phase 9C (Pulse — reference update server): `@mindees/updates` exposes a
**pure, capability-injected update server core** at the `@mindees/updates/server`
subpath (`createUpdateServer`): `resolveUpdate` does channel selection, deterministic
staged rollout, an anti-downgrade mirror, freeze (expiry), and rollback directives;
`getAsset` serves content-addressed blobs (incl. deltas). It **never signs** (serves
pre-signed manifests only). A runnable `node:http` adapter lives in
`examples/pulse-server/`.

Phase 9B (Pulse — differential bundle diffing): `@mindees/updates` ships a
**zero-dependency, pure-TS byte-level delta codec** (`diff` build-side, `applyDelta`
on-device): a changed asset can be shipped as just its delta against a base blob the
client already holds, reconstructed on-device and verified against the manifest's
SHA-256 (a bad/forged delta can never install — it falls back to a full download).

Phase 9A (Pulse — signed OTA core): `@mindees/updates` ships the
working core an app embeds for over-the-air updates: a versioned, hash-addressed
manifest; Ed25519 signing/verification (threshold + key rotation, pure-JS `@noble`,
runs on Hermes/RN); a content-addressed store; and an update client with atomic
generations + crash-loop rollback (verify → download → atomic apply → boot-recovery).

Phase 8E (Helix native strand — on-device render verification): the
JS side has both halves of the native path: the **native command backend**
(`createNativeCommandBackend()`, Phase 8A) and a strict **reference host**
(`createReferenceHost()`, Phase 8B). The real host projects in `examples/native-hosts/`
are **CI-verified** to compile + pass their conformance cores (iOS `swift test` + iOS-SDK
compile, Phase 8C; Android `gradle test` + `assembleDebug`, Phase 8D) **and to render
the command stream into correct native view trees on the platform runtime** (Phase 8E):
an iOS Simulator XCTest asserts the real `UIView` hierarchy, and an Android Robolectric
test asserts the real `android.view` hierarchy (incl. click dispatch via `performClick()`).
**What is NOT yet done: a full app on a physical device** — there is no embedded JS
engine / JS↔native bridge running the reactive app on-device, so **you cannot build a
native mobile app end-to-end with MindeesNative today** — that is Phase 8F.

Phase 7 (Quantum Router II) — complete (render integration +
data/guards/transitions). `@mindees/router` renders (`createRouterView` —
fine-grained, layout-preserving nested rendering; `createLink` — typed links) and
now also does **data loaders** with stale-while-revalidate caching, `AbortSignal`
cancellation, `invalidate()` and `preload()` (intent prefetch); **navigation
guards** (`beforeNavigate` cancel/redirect + idempotent navigation); and **web
view transitions** (`document.startViewTransition`, feature-detected, SSR/native-
safe). Built on `@mindees/core` (the renderer is a test-only devDependency).
Still deferred (not exported): the global typed route registry, file-based route
scanning + bundler plugin, per-key fine-grained loader signals, and native
shared-element transitions.

Phase 6 (Router I) shipped the typed routing core: codegen-free typed path params
(template-literal types), Standard-Schema-validated typed search params (any
Zod/Valibot/ArkType schema, zero runtime dep), a signals-native router with typed
+ relative navigation and selector-isolated route state, dynamic reconfiguration
without state reset, and injectable history (memory + browser).

| `@mindees/renderer` | 🧪 Experimental | Helix reconciler + web/DOM backend + SSR/hydration + headless backend shipped in Phase 3. **Phase 8A** added the native command backend (`createNativeCommandBackend()`): a serializable `NativeCommand` protocol + a `HostBackend` that emits it (events as stable handler ids; subtree-safe disposal). **Phase 8B** added `createReferenceHost()`: a strict reference host that replays + validates the stream — the conformance contract real native hosts implement. The `examples/native-hosts/` iOS + Android host projects compile + pass their conformance cores in CI (Phase 8C/8D) and render the command stream into correct native view trees on the platform runtime (iOS Simulator XCTest; Android Robolectric — Phase 8E). A full app on a physical device over a JS↔native bridge (Phase 8F) + GPU canvas are 🔬. |
| `@mindees/atlas` | 🚧 Scaffold | Lands in Phase 12 (web impls; native 🔬). |
| `@mindees/ai` | 🧪 Experimental | Synapse AI contract shipped in Phase 11A: `createAi` + the `AiBackend` seam (messages/parts, `GenerateRequest`/`AiResult`/`AiChunk`, `AiError`), streaming as `AsyncIterable` only (Node/browser/Hermes-safe), a deterministic `createMockBackend` (offline, no-keys — the working fallback), and a `createOnDeviceBackend` research-track seam that throws. `@mindees/core` only. Server/HTTP backend (11B), Standard-Schema structured output + tool calling (11C), and a dev-time error explainer (11D) build on it. On-device LLM inference is inherently native → 🔬. |

HLC causality (10B), CRDT merge (10C), and delta sync (10D) build on it. Native persistence + production sync server + rich-text CRDTs are 🔬 research tracks. |
| `@mindees/updates` | 🧪 Experimental | Pulse signed-OTA core (Phase 9A): a versioned hash-addressed `UpdateManifest`, Ed25519 `signManifest`/`verifySignedManifest` (≥-threshold distinct trusted keys → key rotation + multi-party signing; detached canonical bytes; pure-JS `@noble`, no WebCrypto/native dep), a content-addressed `UpdateStorage` (blobs by SHA-256 ⇒ unchanged assets aren't re-downloaded) + `createMemoryStorage()`, and `createUpdateClient()` with check/download/apply/boot/notifyReady/rollback — atomic generations, monotonic-version + expiry + runtime gates, and readiness-handshake crash-loop rollback to previous → embedded. **Phase 9B** adds a zero-dep pure-TS byte-level delta codec (`diff`/`applyDelta`, rolling-hash COPY/INSERT) and a `download()` delta path (`AssetEntry.patch`): reconstruct a changed asset from a delta against a stored base, gated by the existing post-apply SHA-256 check with a full-fetch fallback. **Phase 9C** adds the `@mindees/updates/server` subpath — a pure, capability-injected `createUpdateServer` (channel selection, deterministic staged rollout, anti-downgrade mirror, freeze, rollback directives, `getAsset`) that never signs (serves pre-signed manifests), with a runnable `node:http` adapter in `examples/pulse-server/`. **Phase 9D** adds the `@mindees/updates/sdui` subpath — `compileSdui` (allowlisted, schema-versioned JSON tree → `@mindees/core` `MindeesNode`; named actions + reactive `$bind`; no `eval`; prototype-pollution-safe; hard depth/node/string/prop limits) + pure-TS RFC 7396 merge-patch and a safe RFC 6902 subset (`add`/`remove`/`replace`), re-validated before render. **Phase 9 (Pulse) complete.** WASM module runtime is 🔬. |
| `create-mindees` | 🧪 Experimental | `npm create mindees` scaffolder shipped in Phase 5; delegates to `@mindees/cli`'s tested core. |

## Standing research tracks (the honest frontier)

These are real seams in the architecture, deliberately **not** faked. Each has
(or will have) a documented working fallback:

- **TypeScript → native machine code (AOT).** Fallback: typed paths optimized,
  dynamic paths run on an embedded engine / the web target. _(Phase 4)_
- **Native iOS/Android renderer backends.** The platform-neutral **native command
  backend** (Phase 8A) plus a strict **reference host** that replays + validates the
  command stream (Phase 8B) are implemented and tested. The real **iOS (SwiftPM) and
  Android (Gradle) host projects** in `examples/native-hosts/` now **compile + pass
  their conformance cores in CI** (macOS runner: iOS `swift test` + iOS-SDK compile,
  Phase 8C; Linux runner: Android `gradle test` + `assemble`, Phase 8D), **and render
  the command stream into correct native view trees on the platform runtime** (iOS
  Simulator XCTest; Android Robolectric incl. click dispatch — Phase 8E). What remains
  🔬 is a **full app on a physical device** (embedded JS engine + JS↔native bridge
  running the reactive app on-device) — Phase 8F. Fallback today: web/DOM.
  _(Phase 3, 8A, 8B, 8C, 8D, 8E)_
- **GPU canvas strand (wgpu/WebGPU).** _(Phase 3+)_
- **On-device LLM runtime (ExecuTorch / Apple Foundation Models / Gemini Nano).**
  Fallback: deterministic mock + server backend. _(Phase 10)_
- **Sandboxed WASM Component-Model module runtime.** Fallback: first-party
  modules + a validated declarative subset. _(Phases 8/11)_
