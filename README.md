# MindeesNative

### ⚡ The open-source, TypeScript-first cross-platform app framework

**Build native iOS, Android & web apps from one TypeScript codebase.**
A modern **React Native** and **Flutter** alternative — with fine-grained
**signals** reactivity, true native UI, batteries-included tooling, and instant
OTA updates. Built in the open.

## Why MindeesNative? (React Native & Flutter, reimagined)

React Native and Flutter each made one foundational bet, and each created
permanent trade-offs. MindeesNative is designed to **inherit the strengths of
both while engineering away the weaknesses**:

- 🟦 **TypeScript, end to end** — the world's most popular typed language and the
  largest developer talent pool. No new niche language to learn.
- ⚛️ **Fine-grained signals reactivity** — the modern reactivity model (à la
  SolidJS): update *exactly* what changed, with no virtual-DOM diffing and no
  manual memoization. **Shipping today in [`@mindees/core`](./packages/core).**
- 📱 **Native UI by default, GPU canvas when you want it** — render real
  platform components *and* drop to a pixel-perfect GPU canvas, per subtree.
- 🔋 **Batteries included, dependencies excluded** — one cohesive,
  single-versioned SDK instead of dependency-hell roulette.
- 🚀 **Instant OTA updates** — ship fixes without waiting on app-store review.
- 🌍 **Truly universal** — one codebase targeting **iOS, Android, web & desktop**.

> We don't claim these are all done. We're building them in order, in public, and
> labeling exactly where we are. Honesty is a feature.

## ✨ Live example — fine-grained signals (works today)

```ts
import { signal, computed, effect, batch } from '@mindees/core'

const count = signal(0)
const doubled = computed(() => count() * 2)

// re-runs only when something it reads actually changes
effect(() => console.log(`count=${count()} doubled=${doubled()}`))

count.set(1)                 // → count=1 doubled=2
count.update((n) => n + 1)   // → count=2 doubled=4

batch(() => {                // coalesce writes → effect runs once
  count.set(10)
  count.set(20)
})                           // → count=20 doubled=40
```

Glitch-free, lazy, leak-free, and fully typed. See
[`@mindees/core`](./packages/core) for the full API.

### 🧩 Re-render isolation — context that only updates what changed (Phase 2)

```ts
import { createContext, createProvider } from '@mindees/core'

const Session = createContext({ user: { name: 'Ada' }, unread: 0 })
const session = createProvider(Session)

const name = session.select((s) => s.user.name)   // memo, isolated
const unread = session.select((s) => s.unread)     // memo, isolated

session.set({ user: { name: 'Ada' }, unread: 5 })  // only `unread` consumers re-run
```

No more "the whole screen re-rendered because one field changed." MindeesNative
ships a **priority scheduler** and a **Web Worker thread-pool** in the same core,
too — see [`@mindees/core`](./packages/core).

### 🖥️ Render to the DOM with real SSR — crawlable, SEO-friendly (Phase 3)

Unlike Flutter Web (which paints to a canvas search engines can't read),
MindeesNative's **Helix** renderer emits real, crawlable HTML on the server and
hydrates it into a live, fine-grained reactive tree on the client:

```ts
import { renderToString, hydrate } from '@mindees/renderer'
import { signal, createElement as h } from '@mindees/core'

function Counter() {
  const n = signal(0)
  return h('view', { onClick: () => n.set(n() + 1) }, () => `clicked ${n()}×`)
}

// Server: real HTML for SEO + fast first paint
renderToString(Counter, {})        // → '<div>clicked 0×</div>'

// Client (current preview): remount with live, fine-grained reactivity.
// Adopt-in-place hydration (no remount) is tracked as follow-up work.
hydrate(document.getElementById('app'), Counter, {})
```

One renderer, swappable **host backends**: a web/DOM backend, a headless backend,
and a **native command backend** (compiles the tree + reactive updates into a
serializable native command stream — Phase 8A) ship today; the real iOS/Android
hosts that render that stream, and a GPU canvas, are on the roadmap.

### ⚙️ A compiler that won't let type errors ship (Phase 4)

The Mindees Compiler (MDC) is built on the TypeScript Compiler API: a strict
**type-check gate**, a TSX→`createElement` transform, and **tree-flattening**
that turns static UI into create-once constants.

```ts
import { compile, compileChecked } from '@mindees/compiler'

compileChecked('const a: number = "oops"').code        // '' — build refused, type error reported
compile('export const v = <view><text>hi</text></view>').stats
// → { flattenedNodes: 1, totalElements: 2 }  ← static subtree optimized at build time
```

Zero native binaries → deterministic, reproducible builds on every OS and CI.

### 🛠️ One CLI to scaffold, build, and diagnose (Phase 5)

`create-mindees` and the `mindees` CLI (Forge) get you from zero to a running
app — and `mindees doctor` replaces cryptic failures with actionable fixes.

```bash
npm create mindees@latest my-app -- --template counter
cd my-app && pnpm install
mindees build      # type-checks + compiles your app
mindees doctor     # ✓ Node ✓ pnpm ! node_modules missing → run `pnpm install`
```

Built on Node's own `parseArgs` — zero CLI dependencies.

### 🧭 A typed router that beats Expo Router & React Router (Phases 6–7)

The **Quantum** router types your path **and** search params with **zero
codegen** — no generated type files, no dev server, no stale types. Bring any
[Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev) validator (Zod, Valibot, ArkType)
for runtime-validated, fully-typed search params — the capability Expo Router and
React Router don't have:

```ts
import { createRouter, createBrowserHistory } from '@mindees/router'
import { z } from 'zod'

const router = createRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/posts/:postId' },
    { path: '/search', searchSchema: z.object({ q: z.string(), page: z.coerce.number() }) },
  ],
  history: createBrowserHistory(),
})

router.navigate({ to: '/posts/:postId', params: { postId: '42' } }) // ✓ typed; params required
// router.navigate({ to: '/posts/:postId' })                        // ✗ compile error

// Fine-grained reactive route state — re-runs ONLY when this slice changes:
const postId = router.select((s) => s.params.postId)
```

Path params are inferred straight from the pattern string
(`PathParams<'/posts/:postId'>` → `{ postId: string }`), route state is a
**signals graph** (no whole-screen re-render on navigation, no global-vs-local
hook trap), and the route table can be **reconfigured live without resetting**
where the user is.

And it **renders**: `createRouterView` draws the matched route chain with
**fine-grained, layout-preserving** nesting — switching between sibling pages
keeps the parent layout (and its state) mounted, and a same-route param change
(`/posts/1` → `/posts/2`) re-mounts *nothing*; only the bindings that read the
changed param update. Plus a typed `createLink`, **SWR data loaders** (with
`AbortSignal` cancellation, `preload` intent-prefetch, and `invalidate`),
**navigation guards** (cancel / redirect / idempotent), and **web view
transitions**. See [`@mindees/router`](./packages/router).

## ❓ FAQ

**Is MindeesNative a React Native alternative?**
That's the goal — a TypeScript cross-platform framework that keeps React
Native's strengths (familiar language, native UI, OTA updates) while removing
its pain points (dependency hell, single-thread limits, debugging). It's
pre-alpha today.

**Is it a Flutter alternative?**
Yes — without requiring a new language (Dart). You write TypeScript, target iOS,
Android and web, and get fine-grained reactivity and native UI.

**What language does it use?**
100% TypeScript. No new language to learn.

**Can I build mobile apps with it today?**
Not yet — it's pre-alpha. The reactive core, **web** renderer (with SSR), the
compiler, the CLI, and the typed router all work now, and the **native rendering
foundation** (a platform-neutral command backend) has landed (Phase 8A). But a
real **native (iOS/Android) host** that draws those commands to the screen — and
the Atlas UI library — land in upcoming phases, so native apps don't run
end-to-end yet. ⭐ Star and watch the repo to follow progress.

**Is it open source?**
Yes — dual-licensed **MIT OR Apache-2.0**, built fully in the open.
