# @mindees/updates

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- bf948be: First public release — **v0.1.0**.

  MindeesNative's foundation is complete and audited: fine-grained reactivity, the
  component model + selector-isolated context, the priority scheduler and thread-pool
  abstraction (`@mindees/core`); the Helix renderer with web/DOM + headless backends,
  SSR/hydration, and a CI-verified native strand on iOS (JavaScriptCore) and Android
  (QuickJS) (`@mindees/renderer` + `examples/native-hosts`); the build-time optimizer
  (`@mindees/compiler`); the Forge CLI + `create-mindees` scaffolder; the Quantum typed
  router with data loaders, guards, and view transitions (`@mindees/router`); the Pulse
  signed-OTA + SDUI system (`@mindees/updates`); the Continuum local-first CRDT store +
  sync engine (`@mindees/data`); the Synapse AI gateway (`@mindees/ai`); and the Atlas
  accessible primitives + virtualized list (`@mindees/atlas`).

  APIs are 🧪 experimental (pre-1.0); see `STATUS.md`. This `minor` bump versions the
  whole locked `@mindees/*` line at `0.1.0`.

### Patch Changes

- 86e5b94: Post-review hardening pass over the audit fixes (follow-ups confirmed with regression tests), plus a cross-package typecheck repair:

  - **`@mindees/renderer` — SSR element-tag injection (security)** — `serializeHeadless` interpolated the (possibly `mapTag`-mapped) tag into `<tag>`/`</tag>` unescaped, so a tag containing `>`/whitespace could break out and inject markup. The tag is now validated against the attribute-name grammar and rejected (fail closed) if unsafe.
  - **`@mindees/atlas` — `Pressable` style typecheck regression** — tightening `Accessor<T>` to a strict `() => T` left the 1-arg interaction-state style fn leaking into the `resolveStyle` branch. The arity-narrowed branch now asserts `Reactive<StyleInput>`, mirroring the state-fn cast, so the package typechecks again.
  - **`@mindees/atlas` — horizontal `ScrollView` layout was inert** — the row layout set `flexDirection`/`flexWrap` without `display: 'flex'`, so the element stayed in default block flow. `display: 'flex'` is now included.
  - **`@mindees/ai` — Anthropic streaming dropped `input_tokens`** — prompt tokens arrive on `message_start` while output tokens arrive on `message_delta`; the parser now carries `input_tokens` through to the finish chunk instead of reporting only output tokens.
  - **`@mindees/data` — HLC drift ceiling could ratchet** — the clamp ceiling is anchored to `physical + maxDriftMs` (not `max(localWall, physical) + maxDriftMs` re-added per merge), so repeated far-future merges can't walk the clock forward. The LWW same-stamp tie-break also tags `-0` distinctly from `+0` so a `-0`-vs-`+0` tie still converges.
  - **`@mindees/updates` — non-idempotent re-apply** — re-applying the already-current generation fell through and rewrote state, resetting `pendingVerification`/`bootAttempts` and un-confirming a generation that had already passed its readiness handshake. It now short-circuits to a true no-op.
  - **`@mindees/compiler` — marker collision missed destructuring** — the `_static` top-level collision check ignored destructuring bindings (`const { _static } = x`); it now recurses object/array binding patterns so flattening still bails on a real collision.
  - **`@mindees/cli` — overly specific scaffold error** — the unreadable-target message asserted "not a directory" for every `readDir` failure even though it could be a permission/I/O error; the message no longer claims a cause it didn't verify.

- e292c63: Security/audit hardening for `@mindees/updates` (Pulse). An adversarial security review of the signing, crypto, delta, SDUI, server, and store layers confirmed two defects (the Ed25519 signing, delta codec, and content-addressed store held up); both are fixed with regression tests:

  - **Anti-downgrade gate at apply (medium)** — `apply()` used `version < highestVersion`, while `download()`/`check()`/the server all enforce a `<=` floor. That let a _different_ bundle signed at the _same_ version laterally replace a confirmed-good current generation (a same-version signed-downgrade / lateral-move vector). `apply()` now rejects activating a different bundle once the high-water mark has reached that version, while still allowing an idempotent re-apply of the already-current generation.
  - **SDUI merge-patch prototype pollution (medium)** — `applyMergePatch`'s base-copy loop lacked the `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` guard that every other tree walk in the module has, so an own `__proto__` key in the _base_ document (e.g. from `JSON.parse` of the prior OTA doc) corrupted the returned object's prototype via the `__proto__` setter — contradicting the module's "prototype-pollution-safe" guarantee. The base-copy loop now rejects forbidden keys like the patch loop does.

  Also freezes the exported `info` object (consistency with `@mindees/core`/`@mindees/renderer`).
